      <p>
        <span class="bold forestgreen ul">CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)</span> is
        a language in web development to style and position elements of html
        files. There are many ways to include CSS code in a website.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="indianred">
          <span class="ul bold black">Inline CSS :</span> This is a very
          straightforward way of injecting CSS code in an element of html file.
          CSS code in written as style attribute of the element. This type of
          CSS code has the highest precedence as it is injected directly into
          the html element.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li class="indianred">
          <span class="ul bold black">Internal CSS :</span> This can be used
          when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely. The CSS rule set
          should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e. the CSS is
          embedded within the HTML file.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li class="indianred">
          <span class="ul bold black">External CSS :</span> External CSS
          contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the
          help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, â€¦ etc.). CSS
          property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be
          linked to the HTML document using link tag. This means that for each
          element, style can be set only once and that will be applied across
          web pages.
