    <p>
      Information Technology is most prominent and rapidly developing field in
      todays world. To maintain speed with latest trends in Information
      Technology industry, our Information Technology department is fully
      empowered. Our fully air-conditioned laboratories contain sufficient
      number of computer systems with latest hardware and software
      configuration. Since IT is composed of data processing and transmission,
      we are having latest communication hardware and software with proper
      multimedia support to each system. A very high speed internet connection
      is there in the labs. Net surfing is provided to the students as per their
      requirements. Guest faculty specialized in respective fields of
      Information Technology are invited from time to time to keep students in
      touch with latest trends in technology and to broaden their spectrum of
      knowledge. All facilities in the labs are continuously examined and
      upgraded whenever required. The department has well qualified and
      experienced faculty for guiding students in right direction. Our aim here
      is to expose students to latest and growing technologies which help them
      to become highly skilled IT professional.
